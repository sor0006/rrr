Hello!

Selene the baddie — 5:13 PM:
hello?

Targ — 5:13 PM:
Hope you don’t mind me reaching out out of the blue.
I found your Discord through your Roblox bio and I just had to say—
your avatar looks amazing. The style is super clean.

Selene the baddie — 5:14 PM:
Oh thanks! 🙂

Targ — 5:15 PM:
Actually, I was also wondering something…
Would you be interested in being a model for my new Roblox game?
I’m paying people to let me feature their fits.
If you're down, I can give you **5k Robux** for letting me use your avatar.

Selene the baddie — 5:15 PM:
Are you for real? What's your roblox game?

Targ — 5:16 PM:
Yeah i'm being for real.
Here’s the game:
https://www.roblox.com/games/111815812397687/CHRISTMAS-Matching-Outfits
It’s not fully released yet,
but your avatar fits the theme perfectly and would help me promote it.
I'm willing to pay **5,000 Robux** just for your permission.

Selene the baddie — 5:17 PM:
Hm okay you have my permission to use it.

Targ — 5:18 PM:
Perfect! Thank you.
Do you mind sending me your **avatar file** then?
I need it so I can import your outfit into my developer tools.

Selene the baddie — 5:19 PM:
How do I get my avatar file? I'm not fimilar with this type of stuff can you help me?

Targ — 5:20 PM:
Yeah of course, it’s super easy.
I have a tutorial that all my models use:

It only takes like 30 seconds.

Selene the baddie — 5:21 PM:
okay I'll be doing it shortly, also when do i get paid?

Targ — 5:22 PM:
Right after you're finished giving me your avatar file 🙂
Once you send it, I confirm it on my end
and then immediately send the 5,000 Robux payout.
No delays, I’ve paid others today already.

Targ — 5:23 PM:
Take your time though! Let me know if you need help with the steps.
